                        Sectioning content is a subset of flow content, 
                        and can be used everywhere flow content is expected. 
                        Elements belonging to the sectioning content model 
                        create a section in the current outline that defines 
                        the scope of &#60;header&#62; elements, &#60;footer&#62; 
                        elements, and &#60;heading&#62; content.<br><br>
                        Elements belonging to this category are &#60;article&#62;,
                        &#60;aside&#62;, &#60;nav&#62;, and &#60;section&#62;.

                                composition in a document, page, application, or site, 
                                which is intended to be independently distributable or 
                                reusable (e.g., in syndication).</td>

                            <td>The aside HTML element represents a portion of a document 
                                whose content is only indirectly related to the document's 
                                main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or 
                                call-out boxes.</td>

                            <td>The nav HTML element represents a section of a page whose 
                                purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the 
                                current document or to other documents. Common examples of 
                                navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and 
                                indexes.</td>

                                section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific 
                                semantic element to represent it. Sections should always 
                                have a heading, with very few exceptions.</td>
