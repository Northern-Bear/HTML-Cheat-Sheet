                    Sectioning content is a subset of flow content, 
                    and can be used everywhere flow content is expected. 
                    Elements belonging to the sectioning content model 
                    create a section in the current outline that defines 
                    the scope of <code>&#60;header&#62;</code> elements, 
                    <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> elements, and <code>&#60;heading&#62;</code> 
                    content.<br><br>Elements belonging to this category are <code>&#60;article&#62;</code>,
                    <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code>, and <code>&#60;section&#62;</code>.

                            which is intended to be independently distributable or

                            main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or 
                            call-out boxes.</td>

                            purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the 
                            current document or to other documents. Common examples of 
                            navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and 
                            indexes.</td>

                            have a heading, with very few exceptions.</td>
